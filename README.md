## PortView

PortView is an underdevelopment security application designed to host a variety of useful tools that IT nerds, cybersecurity hobbyists and advanced computer users will find useful. 
PortView is made using the PySide6 development library in Python. I'm mainly doing port-related tools for now, hence the name "PortView". Also, the code is extremely long because I have a few issues in my code which can only be solved by having more code than usual. I'm working on it though.

## NOTE:

When downloading, replace the "INSERT YOUR IP ADDRESS" field in the run_scan function with your actual ip address. 
Also when downloading, download the .ico file along with the main script and place them both in the same folder.
